# smart-garage
This is an advanced garage-door automation solution that combines convenience and safety. It automatically opens and closes your garage door as you arrive or leave, removing the need for manual operation. A built-in anti-pinch function protects your vehicle and property by detecting obstacles and preventing the door from closing when something is in the way.
For added security, SmartGarage features a Sentry Mode that monitors the garage and helps deter or alert you to potential break-ins, providing peace of mind whether youâ€™re home or away. Perfect for homeowners who want convenient, secure control of their garage and home devices. Whether you're at work, on vacation, or just inside your house, stay connected to your smart garage.
